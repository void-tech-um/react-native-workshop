# React Native Workshop

This is the completed project for the React Native Workshop. Feel free to look over it to remind yourself of the concepts we covered.

You can find the detailed setup in the [docs](./docs/README.md) folder. Or you can go to the [live site](https://voidtechmichigan.com/react-native-workshop/).

## Quick Start

Install the dependencies:

```console
$ ./install solution
```

Run the development server:

```console
$ cd solution/
$ npm start
```

## Running the app

To run the app, you will need to have the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) app installed on your device. You can also use the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/) to run the app on your computer.

Start the development server with `npm start` or `npx expo start`

To open the app:

- On your Android device, press "Scan QR Code" on the "Home" tab of the Expo Go app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.
- On your iPhone or iPad, open the default Apple "Camera" app and scan the QR code you see in the terminal.

## Available Scripts

### Populate the Database

```console
$ node generator/populateApi.js
```

This script will populate the database with some hardcoded data. You can run it as many times as you want, but it will have duplicate data.

### Install Dependencies

```console
$ ./install DIR
```

This script will install the dependencies for the project in the specified directory.
